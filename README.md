# Kiki-lang is a hobby made imperative programming language

to build use "go build main.go lexer.go parser.go interpreter.go stack.go iterator.go eval.go"

To try test.a file, compile the go files using run.sh for Linux and run.ps1 for Windows. Use the executable with 2 arguments, the file name and the intepretation type. If the interpretation type is 0, it will run normally, if it's 1 it will print additional messages about the interpretation process, such as value evaluations and other.

    # comments are written after cage sign
    a = 2           # variable declaration, possible value types are Number, Boolean, Array and String
    
    # the language supports basic arithmetics, boolean algebra and array operations
    a = 3*(2+2)/5       # arithmetics: +, -, *, /
    b = (a==2.4)&True   # Boolean algebra: True, False, & and, | or, ! not
    c = [1,2,3]

    c = c^[1,2,3]   # ^ operation appends array
    c = c^[a+2]     # to append a single value wich is not an array, first make it an array
    q = c~1         # array indexing operation: ~

    str = "abc"     # strings are just a Number Array, indexing them returns a Number, append operation works the same way
    str = str^"def"

    # Decision making and loops: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

    if str~0 == 97 then
        a = True
    end

    i=0
    while i < 10 do
        i=i+1
    end

    # Functions are pure, they can't modify outside variables and must always return a value, they can't be called outside of an expression, expect some pre-made functions. They are also first class and can be passed as an argument using the $ reference sign

    function add(a,b)
        return a+b
    end
    function do_func(f,x,y)
        return f(x,y)
    end

    a=do_func($add, 2,3) # function references are used with $ sign

    # Pre-made functions are:
    
    print(a, "alo", "\n") # prints any permissable value, doesn't print new line by default
    r = read()            # reads input from console and immidietly evaluates it
    # writing 2+2 in console will asign r to 4
    # it can be used inside any expression

    print(len(str))       # len returns length of the array or string
    byte("a")             # returns the ascii number of the character, can accept only one argument as a string
    if str~0 == byte("a") then
        print(str~0)
    end

    panic("message")    # throws an error with the argument value, accepts only single argument

    a=file_read(str)      # returns the text inside the file, argument is the file name
    file_write("foo.txt", "text") # writes the second argument inside the first argument's file

    import("test.a")      # imports the file's text into the current file, replacing the line import statement
    # it can be called as a statement anywhere

    # Example functions
    
    function fibonacci(n)
        if n <= 1 then
            return n
        end
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    end

    function map(arr, f)
        newarr=[]
        i=0
        l=len(arr)
        while i < l do
            newarr=newarr^[f(arr~i)]
